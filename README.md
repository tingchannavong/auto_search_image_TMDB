# auto_search_image_TMDB
This application will automate the process of downloading images from TMDB using my personal movie list in order to use it to post a review on my instagram account.

I already have my list of favorites in Couchsurfing App. I want to find picture covers of my favorites and upload to IG with captions of why I like them and how is it good etc.

I plan to achieve this by using python script to automate processes / pain points:

-Excel sheet to store titles, captions
-Finding pictures on TMDB for each title repetitively
-Upload each picture (stored in one place) with the right caption

The search files are divided to search for TV show and images.
